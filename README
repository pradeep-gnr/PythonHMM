###### PythonHMM ####

A Python implementation of the Hidden Markov Model algorithm 

#### Current State ###

--> Basic code updated for HMM Training. Yet to add decoding and other HMM capabilities

#### To run ####
Required : numpy

python HMM.py ip.csv op.pkl 

ip.csv - input_file
op.pkl - pickled model with parameters in a dictionary format !

(OR)

model = PythonHMM(K) # where K is the number of states in the HMM
model.trainHMM()

#### Input format ####

The model is currently built for numeric time series data. Each line in the input file must be comma seperated for each time slot.For example

1,2,3,4,5,3
4,5,6,7,8,3
2,3,4,5,6,4
2,2,3,4,5,5
1,4,5,2,1,5

The example denotes a time series input consisting of (N=5) data vectors and (T=6) distinct time slots.
